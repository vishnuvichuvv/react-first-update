-fetch
-asynch await

redirection in react
-------------------
react-router-dom
        npm i react-router-dom

        import {
             BrowserRouter as Router    -all routing need components
             Routes                     -to set path for each components 
             Route                      -morethan one path            
              } from 'react-router-dom';



useParams  - hook used to access params from components url


REDUX
-----

coupling  -many connection between parent and child component

props drilling  - in coupling if any intermediate component have any error
                  all other childs will note work

-to avoid props drilling we need t reduce coupling and make all the components independent

for this react introduce a new technology - state management technology -REDUX  


REDUX PROCESS
-------------

create a new js file to keep the state all the component can access the js file

        -the components only can acess the datas from the js file
        - but we cant update the datas js file



libraries to apply REDUX
------------------------

1-REDUX
2-REACT REDUX
3-REDUX THUNK

          npm i redux react-redux redux-thunk 

createStore() - method in redux used to create store in js file
                2 arguments are expexting

                1 -reducer 
                2 -middleware

        middleware are used to make synchronous redux into asynchronous

applyMiddleware - method in REDUX to apply middleware

combineReducers() - method in REDUX used to combine all the reducer in js file

thunk -used to create middleware

(...) -spreadoperater - convert object to array

1. create store
2. apply the store in index.js   
        -provider  its a tag used to pass the store (react-redux)
